<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>This app is an idea, which evolved during the conceptualization phase for potential map apps, inspired solely from having brainstormed on the “hot words” ‘Fremdsein’ and ‘Heimat’ during the first Fremdsein 4.0 workshop.

style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Idea for a Map App</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>“Not feeling at home” is a very personal experience. For every individual it is linked to other aspects of life. Such aspects could be food, experienced freedom, and weather, surrounding landscape, vegetation or culture among others. However, depending on how you were brought up, the experience of particular aspects e.g. food differs: German people are particular about bread, Indians complain about the rice German people prepare, and what is called ‘ugali’ in Kenya is named ‘posho’ in Uganda and ‘papp’ in South Africa but it was claimed not to be the “same”. With the world getting smaller due to globalization and affordable travelling for many, our hypothesis is that “Not feeling at home” is nowadays not necessarily related to the physical distance from home. We want to show this.

By selecting
countries based on an interactive world map, the user’s choice is not biased
from the start but done on the widest possible range.</span></p>

By asking for five
countries to select, a balance is sought between stretching across people’s
world and feasibility for a meaningful ranking.</span></p>

By providing a mix
of set and open topics or items to rank, user results can be directly compared
as well as that it allows for unexpected ideas.

By adjusting relative closeness between ranked countries, the user spends more time
thinking about “foreignness”

rankings or comment on what they have learned.</span></p>

Realization of the ‘Emotional
Foreignness Ranking’ App</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The app asks for six tasks by the user: First, by means of an interactive world map the home country as well as five countries have to be selected for a ranking on “foreignness”. Next, the user learns about fixed topics as well as to what regard choices for ranking still have to be made. Third, the countries’ order needs to be swapped by the user and, further, distances in regard to being more “similar / close” or “foreign” can be adjusted based on personal experience or expectations. When finished, the user hits a button and the final output layout is prepared adding a feature on physical distances, which is automatically calculated. This will allow for comparison and thoughts. A text field provides the opportunity for leaving a statement/comment. Finally, a PDF is created which can be printed for taking home. In addition, there is the option of opening screenshots of other user results (if prior consent was given, which also includes permission to store the user input).
</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>
Technically, for the exhibition a robust offline version of a browser-based application employing
mainly HTML5 and JavaScript (Leaflet) was favoured. The app is database-driven (using SQLite) for storing user input und
results. As geodata we used Natural Earth 4.1.0 Admin 0 - Countries (1:110m and 1:50m scales, slightly modified).
