<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Geert Hofstede, Gert Jan Hofstede, Michael Minkov and others offer 6 “dimensions of culture”. These describe basic issues for society to organize itself (based on a comprehensive study of how values in the workplace are influenced by culture; collected at IBM from 1967 to 1973). The dimensions do not exist, they are the product of our imagination. Culture is defined here “as the collective mental programming of the human mind which distinguishes one group of people from another”. As such, culture influences patterns of thinking which again is reflected in the meaning that people attach to various aspects of life and which become crystallized in the institutions of a society or as habitus in various social milieus. Obviously, everyone does not think the same, but most of us are strongly influenced by social control. So any statement on the culture of a nation is a generalization. The cultural dimensions represent independent preferences, which distinguish countries from one another and only become meaningful by comparison. Today Hofstede’s work is continued in the GLOBE project which defines 9 dimensions and focusses more on societal culture in institutions and enterprises.

Dimensions</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The dimensions
can be summarized as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>1) <i>Power
Distance:</i><b> </b>Extent to which the less powerful (like the family) accept
and expect that power is distributed unequally; society’s handling of
inequalities among people</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>2) <i>Individualism:
</i>Extent to which people feel independent vs feeling as part of a larger
whole; degree of interdependence a society maintains among its members;
people’s self-image</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>3) <i>Masculinity:</i><b>
</b>Extent to which the use of force is endorsed socially / about expected
emotional gender roles; preference in society for: driven by competition,
achievement and success vs caring for others and quality of life; what
motivates people (sociocultural)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>4) <i>Uncertainty
Avoidance:</i><b> </b>Deals with people’s or a society’s tolerance for
uncertainty and ambiguity (anxiety and distrust in the face of the unknown or
wish for fixed habits and rituals and to know the truth)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>5) <i>Long-term
Orientation:</i><b> </b>Deals with change: preparing for the future is always
needed (long-term) vs the past provides a moral compass (short-term);
orientation of people or the society</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>6) <i>Indulgence:</i><b>
</b>In an indulgent culture it is good to be free, in a restrained culture the
feeling is that life is hard and dutiful; based on the way people were raised and
socialized as small children</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style= "text-align:center;"><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Idea for a Map App</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Today, people do not only travel to experience other countries, they also consider spending time abroad to study or work. Questions arise if one would feel comfortable or could even feel at home in these countries. Instead of checking each country individually, the idea is to allow for a worldwide comparison based on Hofstede’s dimensions of culture.

<p class=MsoNormal style= "text-align:center;"><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Realization of
the ‘Ideal Home Finder’ App</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The app consists of five components: user input via rating, visualization on a world map, interactive exploration tools, a possibility for comments, and data storage. It starts by asking the user one question per dimension, which results in a rating of what the user considers to reflect his/her ideas of feeling comfortable in a society. By also requesting an importance ranking, the app derives a value per country by means of calculating the sum of the differences between the values specified by the user and those gathered by Hofstede and others. These values are visualized on a world map using five colour shades and can be considered as an indicator for the likelihood of feeling at home in a certain country. Here only countries with an area larger than 5000 km² are considered, i.e. those visible on the world map. Interactivity allows exploration of which of the countries based on an own rating would fit best to the user’s cultural expectations and why. A comment field allows for statements as the user might discover that the resulting world map does not match with own experiences or expectations and wants to reflect on it. The user’s input is stored anonymously and only with the user’s consent and can thus also be viewed by others.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Technically,
for the exhibition a robust offline version of a browser-based application employing
mainly HTML5 and JavaScript (Leaflet) was favoured. The app is database-driven (using SQLite)
for providing the Hofstede dimension values plus for storing user input und
results. As geodata we used Natural Earth 4.1.0 Admin 0 - Countries (1:110m scale, slightly modified).
